					C Programming Tutorial-Chapter 2
				","							C Programming Tutorial-Chapter 2============================Things Covered In Chapter 2Types of Data in CHow the Computer Stores DataFormatting text using printf()	Placeholders	Escape Sequences============================I assume that you've read the first chapter of this tutorial.Ohterwise you can get it at:http://www.antionline.com/showthread...hreadid=137499Types of Data in CThis information may seem a bit superfluous at this stage, but read it anyway because you won't undestand the next section (or the ramaining chapters in the tutorial) without it. In C, there are two basic types of data: numerical and string. Numerical data is any number like say, 20 or 54.76 while string data is alphanumeric data like say, cgkanchi or hello world!. String data, in C is always enclosed in double quotes so 20 is a string while 20 isn't (don't worry, it'll get clearer as you go along). Numerical data in C is of three basic types:1. char: As you might guess, char data consists of single characters (which are just numbers to the computer). But char data can also store numbers in the range of -128 to +127 (I'll get to that in the next section). char data is always enclosed in single quotes, like so 'c'.2. int: Integer data stores whole numbers from -32,768 to +32,767.3. float: Float or floating point data is used to store decimal numbers between 3.4 x 10 ^ -38 to 3.4 x 10 ^ 38 (10 ^ 38 is read as 10 raised to 38. So 2 ^ 2 would be 2 raised to 2 or two squared which is 4).What about bigger numbers? Well there's a long data type to store integer data between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 and the double data type to store data between 1.7 x 10 ^ -308 to 1.7 x 10 ^ 308. What about char? There is no such thing as a long char but if you want to store a number greater than 127 then just use an int instead. You can also qualify any of these types as unsigned which means all data they store is positive or zero. So the range of char changes from -128 to 127 to 0 to 255, that of int changes from -32,768 to 32,767 to 0 to 65,535 and so on. For some background information on how exactly the computer stores data read the next section. Otherwise, just skip to the section on screen output.How the Computer Stores DataThe computer is a digital creature. So it stores everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the form of numbers. Actually it stores all the data that you put into it as binary code. So, to the computer, any data is stored in the form of 1s and 0s. The computer has small compartments of data called bits. Every bit can store either a 1 or a 0. In other words, a bit can have only one value at any given time. Now, eight bits make a byte. A data which is qualified as char occupies one byte of memory. Similarly, int data occupies 2 bytes, float and long data 4 bytes and double data 8 bytes. Given seven places, each of which has two possible values (in this case 0 and 1), there are 128 possible combinations. That's why a char has a range of  -128 to 127. What about the eighth bit you ask? Well, the eighth bit is called the sign bit and is used to store the sign of the number. When you qualify data as unsigned, the sign bit isn't used. Given eight places, each with two possible values, there are 256 possible combinations. That makes the range of an unsigned char into 0 to 255.Formatting Text Using printf()We ended our last chapter with an analysis of the hello.c program. Remember the statement that does most of the work in the program? Yes I'm talking about the printf(Hello World!); thing. printf stands for print formatted and is one of the most popular ways to output text to the screen. Type in this program to see the different types of data:/*data.cA program to illustrate the different types of data*/#include <stdio.h>void main(){    printf(This is char data: %c\\n,'A');    printf(This is char data in numerical form: %c\\n,65);    printf(This is int data %d:\\n,65);    printf(This is float data: %f\\n,65.00);    printf(This is float data with only two decimals data: %.2f\\n,65.00);    printf(This is double data: %2f\\n,65.00);    printf(This is a string: %s,Hello);}Save this program as data.c . Compile. Fix errors. Run.This program is very similar to the hello.c program in chapter 1 except that it has many printf statements. The major difference is the %something things. The % sign followed by a letter is known as a placeholder. What a placeholder does is that it tells the printf statement to look for a particular type of data after the final double quote(). You can have multiple placeholders in a single statement. In this case, the printf statement looks for data in the order in which the placeholders appear.Here is a list of placeholders and what they do:Placeholder                             What it does%c                                          Displays char data%i, %d                                    Display int data%f                                           Displays float data%2f                                         Displays double data%.2f                                        Displays float with the requisite                                               number of decimals as                                                specified after the period(.)%s                                          Displays string data%o                                          Displays octal data (more on octal                                                and hexadecimal in another chapter)%x                                          Displays hexadecimal dataAs the % sign has a special meaning for printf, to display it, you must double it up. For example, printf(Something%%); will display Something%Remember the \\n thing that makes the printf statement go to the next line? That is called an escape sequence. Escape sequences consist of a backslash(\\) and a letter following them. Escape sequences can be used to do a lot of interesting things in C. They are used simply by tagging them on at any point in a string. For example printf(Hel\\nlo); makes the program display Hel on one line and lo on the next.Here is a list of some of the escape sequences:Escape Sequence                  What it does\\n                                          Goes down to the beginning of the next line\\r                                           Goes back to beginning of line\\t                                           Prints a tab\\                                            Goes down one line without going                                              back to the beginning of the line\\x                                          Recognizes the next characters(upto                                              the next space) as hexadecimal                                              numbers\\o                                          Recognizes the next characters(upto                                              the next space) as octal numbers\\a                                          The computer speaker lets out a                                              beep\\b                                          Goes back one characterIn addition to these certain characters have a special meaning for the printf function. So to display them you must precede them by a backslash. The two most notable ones are the backslash itself and the double quotes(). So, to display a backslash you'd type \\\\ and to display double quotes you'd type \\(the first and the last are the double quotes for the string and the middle one is the oune you want to display).So, that's all for chapter 2 of my C tutorial. Until next time, I'll give you a few assignments to do.1. Write a program to display the sentence I Love C, said the programmer. (With the quotes).2. Write a program to display Hello!Hi!Howdy!Using only a single printf statement. (Hint: remember \\n).3. Write a program to display C:\\ABC\\ABC\\ (without the quotes).Don't hesitate to ask any doubts or questions related to the tutorial. And experienced programmers who happen to read this, please fill in any placeholders or escape sequences I might have missed.

				","							Not being a senior member here, I may be out of line but I believe most of the seniors will back this post.First of all, welcome to Antionline.Antionline is a forum for discussion of technical security issues.Most of the regular contributors here concentrate on the practice of PREVENTING hackers from entering your system and doing damage, not hacking into others.If you ask questions like, How do I hack into my schools computer or How do I hack into Hotmail, you will most likely receive a Negative response.If you came here to learn how to hurt other people or to engage in illegal activities, don't expect a lot of help.If you must be malicious, go  here  and follow the instructions. Then go  here  and learn about trojans. You'll be reformatting someones drive by nightfall.That's it. Unless you are willing to spend a lot of time reading and learning, your hacking abilities are going to end there.On the other hand, if you are willing to spend some time and put forth an effort to learn, you will find this a very helpful and friendly site.For starters, here are a couple tutorials:The  Happy Hacker  provides some entertaining and easy to understand information.Here is another nice tutorial called Digital VoodooThere have been some excellent posts made here by some of the members. If you have a specific question, go here  to search the forums. Your question may have already been answered before.Most of all, enjoy yourself and remember.... hacking is not about hurting other people or destroying someones data. It's about the computer, how it works and why it does the things that it does.The computer is a miracle of the modern age. A blessing that should be treated as such. A hobby that will never end and can provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment.Enter the computer with patience and understanding and it will return the same. Enter with evil and deception and you will eventually receive your just reward. If you don't feel this way, I believe you may be at the wrong site.Anyway, welcome to Antionline and welcome to the world of computers. I hope they are both as rewarding to you as they have been for me.

				","							Thats the entire problem! The internet goes beyond the scope of a goverment. The threat of punishment can only reduce domestic attacks. A huge amount of crackers come from anti-american goverments who we do not have the ability to punish. In short the only way we can secure the internet, at least for americans, is to shift into a offensive mood. In other words we figure out our problems before our enemys do. It would be best for the USA's goverment to support a program to do this. But they will sit on their ass until something major happens :/The only other way I can think of is to have a private organization to do this. The security of this would have to be intense with very strong encription and recurits would have to be carefully looked over. You could perhaps get fudning from other private sectors in the security world for your information... This needs to be done bad, I don't sleep well at night knowing that their could be a Large Scale attack supported by a goverment or a terrorist organization who could effectively cripple our telecommunications industry and send our encomy into a depression. Open Source thats being pushed in other countries is definitly going to have drastic effects on what we see out of attackers.

 NASA hacker gets 21 months in jail
				","							A prolific computer criminal who admitted breaking into NASA  computers was sentenced to 21 months in prison on Monday. Jason Allen Diekman, who went by the nicknames Shadow Knight and Dark Lord, was also ordered to pay $88,000 in fines and restitution. The 20-year-old Californian admitted to hacking computers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and other NASA computers at Stanford University during November 2000.Diekman admitted breaking into hundreds of computers at an impressive list of government and university institutions. On the list: Stanford, Harvard, Cornell University, the California State University at Fullerton and University of California campuses in Los Angeles and San Diego, according to the U.S. Attorneys California Central District office.The judge (Dean D. Pregerson) told the defendant that what he had done was very disruptive and caused tremendous harm to a number of people. ... In fact, the judge called his conduct insidious, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Arif Alikhan, chief of the districts Computer Crimes Section. So I think the judge acknowledged the seriousness of the offenses.Even while Diekman was free on bond after pleading guilty in the NASA case, he used his home computer to gain unauthorized access to computers at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Alikhan said.He later pleaded guilty to that crime  which included spending 8,000 minutes of conference call time stolen from AT&T. Much of that time was used trying to arrange fraudulent wire transfers through Western Union, Alikhan said. He said Diekman was trying to wire money to himself using stolen credit to fund the transfer.Also after the initial guilty plea, Diekman admitted breaking into machines at Bay Area Internet Solutions Inc., an Internet service provider in San Jose. According to Alikhan, Diekman and others then managed to get copies of various company databases that contained account information and passwords.The NASA computer systems at Stanford that Diekman broke into were used to develop sensitive satellite flight control software that controlled NASA satellites, according to the U.S. attorneys office.Diekman has been held in a federal jail without bond since his arrest in the OSU hacking case on April 18, 2001.Source: www.blackcode.com  and www.xatrix.org",2.0,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97702026, 'word': 'NASA', 'start': 63, 'end': 67}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99108726, 'word': 'Jason Allen Diekman', 'start': 127, 'end': 146}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.59384954, 'word': 'Shadow', 'start': 174, 'end': 180}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.4109094, 'word': 'Knight', 'start': 181, 'end': 187}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5766049, 'word': 'Dark', 'start': 192, 'end': 196}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.3981009, 'word': 'Lord', 'start': 197, 'end': 201}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4130204, 'word': 'California', 'start': 277, 'end': 287}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.3624846, 'word': '##n', 'start': 287, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92770475, 'word': 'NASA', 'start': 322, 'end': 326}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.79495054, 'word': 'Jet Propulsion Laboratory', 'start': 328, 'end': 353}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9617203, 'word': 'Pasadena', 'start': 357, 'end': 365}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9119646, 'word': 'NASA', 'start': 376, 'end': 380}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96888804, 'word': 'Stanford University', 'start': 394, 'end': 413}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9670429, 'word': 'Diekman', 'start': 435, 'end': 442}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97378516, 'word': 'Stanford', 'start': 566, 'end': 574}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9643864, 'word': 'Harvard', 'start': 576, 'end': 583}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98983824, 'word': 'Cornell University', 'start': 585, 'end': 603}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9685008, 'word': 'California State University at Fullerton', 'start': 609, 'end': 649}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9863212, 'word': 'University of California', 'start': 654, 'end': 678}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.92002714, 'word': 'Los Angeles', 'start': 691, 'end': 702}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.8660841, 'word': 'San Diego', 'start': 707, 'end': 716}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7242923, 'word': 'U.

My Tools:Latest win distro of Apache web server.Linksys WRT54G wireless routerWhat I've tried:Setup the website just fine. Assinged it to 192.168.1.100:8080. Then I configured my router to port foward all connections besides my own to the address. (sloppy i know, but i wanted to check it real quick) Jumped on a buddy's computer, and it didnt work. After lurking the net for some help I figured out that my port forwarding AND loopback function did not work on my router. Turns out that my firmware had a huge bug in it. I came across a rather interesting story about crazy programmer,Sveasoft,  harassing a website owner for posting firmware code that is under GPL. I know that I am not expirenced enough to be going around  flashing firmware here and there, but I will not rule out this option completely. I do not believe I will be able to accomplish my objective with just my router.I can only think of one possible way to get this to work. I can create and host my own DNS server, and point my router to it. This I am not too froggy about, considering that the webserver was more than I have ever done before.

				","							Hey Hey,I mentioned it to someone else looking for AAA software. You might want to check into netreg... the SouthWest version is the easier version to setup but the Carnegie-Mellon (sp?) definately provides more functionality... Basically you run a dhcp/dns server.. The DHCP server assigns a set of restricted/bad ip addresses along with the address of your rogue dns server. The dns server points them to your webserver and only your webserver which is running the netreg software. After they authenticate (flat file, mysql, ldap (depending on what you setup)), their MAC address is moved to an allowed list on the dhcp server config and if they reboot (or wait one minute and release/renew) then when they obtain their new IP form the DHCP server they get a good ip address with the real DNS servers. It's a fairly simple setup.... and I can help ya out with the setup if you need any assistance. This software is normally run on linux, but I believe there are ports of all the involved software (apache, perl) and Im pretty sure there are windows ports of bind and dhcpd. Anyways...

100,TheGh0st,2003-11-26 02:55:00,\N," Originally posted here by Ironic No, i wanted to know if it was possible that someone port scanning me was behind a proxy or not? I wasnt sure if it could be done or not. If a person is an IT Expert and does this sort of thing for a living, chances are they have friends that are admins and over period of time they accumulate access to a variety of remote servers in various countries that are in fact used as public proxies. Which means they could log into any of those servers from a remote location and induce the scan. For that matter they could do a number of things if they wanted to.  If you run a small network it is also possible you are getting hit by a virus from your subnet.I dont know that is just what I think, I could be wrong.
